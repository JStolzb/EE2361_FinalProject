# EE2361_FinalProject
This is our final project for EE2361

This project implements an "Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)" bluetooth module
that connects to a cellular device that displays a message written out by pressing a button on the breadboard
and this message will be using morse code.

The Microcontroller communicates with the bluetooth module using UART and sends 8-bit data containing letters
that are represented as their ascii character codes.
